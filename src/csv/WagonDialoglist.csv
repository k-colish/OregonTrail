1, As your getting ready to leave that morning another group asks "Are you really going across the plains to California? Are you not afraid of being burned black by the sun and wind?"
2, You hear faintly in the distance "Pickles and ACID!" as you see a worrisome Margaret coming at you.
3, As you pass by another group they ask you "How did you send your house to California? We sent ours on a flatfornia."
4, While you stop for lunch you start speaking with some and they say "So you wanna know how to get to California A? So first you gotta get up too …… and then you will be at Cal-I-FORN-IA"
5, As you pass by another group they ask you "I heard that they kept the flower-scoops to scoop the gold out of the barrels"
6, As you get closer into the night you stop to see someone with a small fire. While walking towards them they stop you to say "you can catch all the water you need as it comes out from the rock." You notice he's looking off in the distance the bit at a big rock with a stream beneath it.
7, Late into the night you see a faint shadow move along the tree line. You think It's just your imagination playing tricks on you. When you ask someone about it they say "That'll happen along the trail you just gotta get there."
8, When you stop for the day a stranger asks you questions about your life. Later that night when you try to sleep this night you slowly hear other voices around you yet when you open yours eyes no one else is there. You hear another soft voice ask you about your life. Then you grab your blanket tightly but struggling to hold onto reality in the midst of the darkness.
9, You pass by a group of other wagons and see everyone getting water. You stop at tell Margaret to fill up her canteen. Others around you ask "Who are you talking about we all have buckets to fill" and "Whom are you speaking too?" Later you see Margaret disappear from your view with a shadowy figure fill her place. Then shadows dance at the edge of your vision as the world around you slowly closes up.
